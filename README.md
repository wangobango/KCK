# ReadingNumbers
KCK

A Python program recognising numbers using OpenCV preprocessing and self-built neural network.

Done in collaboration with @wangobango, who developed the whole neural network from scratch.

# Usage
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Loqaritm/ReadingNumbers.git
```
Navigate to the newly created folder and run the program with Python:
```
cd ReadingNumbers
python3 project.py [filename]
```
**Important!** Do not put ".jpg" in filename. Files to be read are to be located in **data_set/** folder.

To test if everything is working run:
```
python3 project.py 1
```
